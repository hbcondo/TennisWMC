I wrote TennisWMC back in 2012 when I used Windows Media Center (WMC)[^1] to watch live TV and videos on my television using an HTPC[^2] I built. Sadly, WMC has been discontinued by Microsoft and the sports data is no longer available but I all of the sudden remembered by old SVN instance[^3] and finally got around to publishing the plugin's source code. **This repo is now archived.** :heart:

## Claim to Fame
> I particularly like the plug-ins specific to certain hobbies and interests; for example, when developer Amar Kota noticed that the sports strip in WMC didn’t include tennis scores, he wrote a tennis plug-in. I use it at home, and it’s great.
